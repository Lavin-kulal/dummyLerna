# Lerna Getting Started Example

This repo is a small example of using Lerna 7+.

Watch this [10-minute walkthrough](no-video link) to see how new versions of Lerna work.

This repo contains three packages or projects:

- `my-button` (a library of React components)
- `my-input` (a library of React components)

```
packages/
    my-button/
        src/
            ...
        package.json
        rollup.config.json
        jest.config.js

    my-input/
        src/
            ...
        package.json
        rollup.config.json
        jest.config.js
```
